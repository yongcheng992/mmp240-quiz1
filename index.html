<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

<p>Alice was beginning to get very <em>tired</em> of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of<br/> having nothing to do: <strong>once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was<br/> reading</strong>, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <q>and what is the use of a book,</q><br/>thought Alice <q>without pictures or conversations?</q></p>
<p>So she was <em>considering</em> in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made<br/> her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain<br/> would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the <b>daisies</b>, when <em>suddenly</em> a<br/> White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
<p><strong>There was nothing so very remarkable in that;</strong> nor did Alice think it so very much out<br/> of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <q><strong>Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!</strong></q> (when<br/> she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered<br/> at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took<br/> a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started<br/> to her feet, <em>for it flashed across her mind</em> that she had never before seen a rabbit<br/> with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with<br/> <em>curiosity</em>, she <em>ran across</em> the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it<br/> pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
